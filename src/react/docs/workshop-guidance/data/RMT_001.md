# 001: Sensitive data discovery

## Overview

The first step in implementing Zero Trust for your data assets is to identify and categorize these assets according to their sensitivity, whcih encompassess areas like confidentiality, criticality and business impact. 
The following tools are availabel for discovering Sensitive Data across the organization: 
* Out of the box and custom classifiers (A.K.A. Sensitive Information Types). Classifiers enable you to identify documents and emails that contain contents matching certain patterns or criteria. 
    * Out of the box classifirs allow you to detect identifiable informaiton corresponding to well-known entities such as people's national identity numbers, bank accounts or drivers licenses. 
    * Custom sensitive information types can be created to identify non-standard, business-specific identifiers or other sensitive information, or to customize how standard entities are detected.
* Advanced classifiers. These include:
    * Exact Data Match for accurately detecting known personal information such as that corresponding to customers or employees. 
    * Trainable classifiers (both pre-trained and custom) to detect documents likely to belong to certain categories or classes
    * Fingerprints to identify documents closely matching the content in well-known documents.
    * Named entities, which can be used to detect people's names, addresses, credentials and other potentially sensitive data.  
* Content Explorer and the Content Explorer Export PowerShell tool: Individual data assets matching individual classifiers can be identified and investigated in Content Explorer directly. Alternatively, informatioon about all data assets can be identified and exported using PowerShell and imported into a SIEM tool for further analysis. 
* Activity Explorer: it reflects creation, access and sharing of sensitive information in your environment, allowing you to perform an initial assessment of risky behaviors and actions by your users involving sensitive data.
* Unified Audit Log and custom tools built on top of it. Every action related to the creation, modification, classification, discovery or sharing of data in a Microsoft 365 tenant is reflected in the Audit Log, which can be connected to a SIEM to help identify the presence of sensitive information and patterns in its exposure and usage.
