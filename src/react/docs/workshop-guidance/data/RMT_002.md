# 002: Document / Identify all approved cross-boundary data sharing scenarios

## Overview

List all scenarios where potentially sensitive business data is shared across internal security boundaries (e.g. R&D to general user population, privileged users to regular users) in the form of emails or files, in anticipation for classifying it by sensitivity or audience. 
These scenarios can be general in nature (e.g. executives disclosing strategy or plans to employees) or specific (e.g. HR sharing employee rewards information with each employee).
