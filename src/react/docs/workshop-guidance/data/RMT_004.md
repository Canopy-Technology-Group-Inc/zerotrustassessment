# 004: Identify sharing with customers

## Overview

List all known and approved scenarios required by business functions that involve sharing sensitive data with customers of the organization or non-affiliated external persons.
These scenarios might be general in nature (e.g. employee sending a customer files that contain the same customer's PII) or specific(e.g. billing data is shared on a monthly basis by the Finance department with customers as PDF attachments).
Initial identification of common sharing patterns can be done by using tools like Activity Explorer.
