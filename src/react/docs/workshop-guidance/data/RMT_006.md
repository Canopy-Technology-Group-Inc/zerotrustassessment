# 006: Define a data classification taxonomy for the organization based on data sensitivity

## Overview

Different business assets, and in particular business data assets such as documents and emails, must be handled with different levels of precaution and under specific types of controls based on their sensitivity. Sensitivity can be associated with the confidentiality, criticality and business impact of each piece of information. 
Once a classification taxonomy has been defined, it can be implemented through sensitivity labels whcih can then be applied to different assets either automatically or manually.  
A suitable sensitivity level taxonomy must meet the following requirements:
1) Be simple. The taxonomy can't be formed of more than two layers of classification, and each layer should not show more than six different options to a user at any given time to avoid users ignoring them or choosing without careful consideration. Project, role or team-specific labels must be scoped so they aren't displayed unnecessarily to unrelated users. 
2) Reflect the business needs. Labels must be able to accomodate the different types of data assets in the organization, dividing them by their sensitivity, while providing the required security controls for each applicable scenario. 
3) Be easily understandable. Selecting the right label names is critical for users to be able to understand them at a glance. The ordering of the labels must be ovious (e.g. don't use simultaneously terms like "confidential" and "private" since users might not know which one implies a higher level of sensitivity, use terms like "confidential" and "highly confidential" instead), and the terms used must resonate with your users accepted language.

Identify (but do not enforce at this time) access restrictions related to each sensitivity level and business scenario. For example, consider whether users might have a need for copying or printing highly confidential data, whether watermarks are needed to minimize risk of oversharing, and whether specific people in your organization need access at all to the specific types of assets.
