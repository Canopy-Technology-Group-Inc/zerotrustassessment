# 011: Monitor sharing with customers

## Overview

Based on the scenarios of sharing data with customers (external users), design the DLP policies to block external sharing scenarios not matching these patterns. Use both sensitive informaiton types as conditions and sensitivity labels as conditions and DLP rule exceptions to address those scenarios.
Do not enforce the DLP rules at this stage, keep them in simulation mode in order to assess potential impact, and after a few weeks assess if critical business scenarios could have been impacted by these rules if they had been enforced. Adjust the logic of the rules and their enforcement actions (e.g. usage of policy tips, overrides and exceptions) as needed.
