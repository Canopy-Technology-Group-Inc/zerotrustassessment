# 014: Monitor sharing by employees

## Overview

Based on the identified scenarios of sharing data among internal users of the organization (Document / Approve all Data Sharing means), add restrictions to the sensitivity labels you defined in previous steps in a way that aligns with those scenarios. E.g. limit access to "confidential / internal" content to internal users (employees) only. Further restrict Hihgly Confidential data so it can't be copied or printed, and add a watermark to it to discourage other forms of sharing. 

Monitor the application of labels after implementing these restrictions. Ideally, application patterns should not change as a result of the restrictions, if you see significant changes in user behavior work with different stakeholders to understand whether these changes are the result of overly restrictive policies which prevent users from doing their jobs with the data if they label it correctly, or it is due to poor user awareness, training or other factors. Adjust the policies accordingly. 

Also consider the use of Information Barriers to prevent sharing of data between parts of the organization which should be isolated from each other (e.g. account teams working for competing companies, tented projects, highly confidential R&D labs, roles in highly regulated businesses that are in potential conflict with others in the organization if they exchanged content).
