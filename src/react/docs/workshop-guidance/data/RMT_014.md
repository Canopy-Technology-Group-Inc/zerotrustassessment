# 014: Monitor sharing by employees

## Overview

Based on the identified scenarios of sharing data among internal users of the organization (Document / Approve all Data Sharing means), design and configure the DLP policies needed and/or the sensitivity labels needed to address those scenarios.
Also consider the use of Information Barriers to prevent sharing of data between parts of the organization which should be isolated from each other (e.g. account teams working for competing companies, tented projects, highly confidential R&D labs, roles in highly regulated businesses that are in potential conflict with others in the organization if they exchanged content).
