List all uses cases where a file can be automatically identified as sensitive based using Trainable Classifiers (Pretrained classifiers provided by Microsoft and/or Custom trainable classifiers).
Consider whether the out of the box classifiers cover your business needs and have the required accuracy in your environment or they need to be fine-tuned by creating new classifiers based on their matches in your content or using manually selected content.
