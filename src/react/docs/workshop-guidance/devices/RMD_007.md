# 007: Log Analytics

## Overview
In **Microsoft Intune**, you can enhance your monitoring and tracking capabilities by sending logs to **Azure Monitor** using **Diagnostics Settings**. Here's how it works:

1. **Audit Logs**: These logs record activities that generate changes in Intune, such as creating, updating, deleting, assigning, and remote actions. You can route these logs to:
   - **Azure Storage**: Archive data for a set time.
   - **Azure Event Hubs**: Stream logs for analytics using SIEM tools like Splunk and QRadar.
   - **Log Analytics**: Enable rich visualizations, monitoring, and alerting¹.

2. **Operational Logs**: These provide details on user and device enrollment (success or failure) and noncompliant devices. Similar to audit logs, you can route them to the same services¹.

**How to Set It Up**:
- Sign in to the **Azure portal**.
- Navigate to **Log Analytics workspaces**.
- Select the workspace containing Intune diagnostics.
- Under **General**, choose **Logs**.
- Look for the Intune-related logs: **IntuneAuditLogs** and **IntuneOperationalLogs**².

Remember, once you enable this feature, your logs are routed to the Azure Monitor service you choose.
