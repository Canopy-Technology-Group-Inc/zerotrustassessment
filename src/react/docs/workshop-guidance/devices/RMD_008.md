# 008: Data Warehouse

## Overview
The **Intune Data Warehouse** is a powerful tool that provides more information about your mobile environment than the Microsoft Intune admin center. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Purpose**:
   - The Data Warehouse enables you to build custom reports and gain insights into your enterprise mobile environment.
   - It's particularly useful for historical and trending reporting, rather than real-time data.

2. **Key Features**:
   - **Historical Data**: Access historical Intune data, allowing you to analyze trends and patterns over time.
   - **Daily Refresh**: The data is refreshed daily, ensuring you have up-to-date information.
   - **OData Standard**: The Data Warehouse uses the OData standard, making it machine-readable and compatible with analytics tools.

3. **Co-Managed Environments**:
   - If you're using co-managed mobile device management (MDM) with Microsoft Configuration Manager and Intune, retrieve data from Configuration Manager. The Intune Data Warehouse only contains Intune data.
   - For custom reports, consider using a Configuration Manager Power BI dashboard.

4. **Versions**:
   - You can use the v1.0 version of the Intune Data Warehouse by setting the query parameter `api-version=v1.0`.
   - The beta version offers features before they become generally available. To use it, include `api-version=beta` in your URL.
