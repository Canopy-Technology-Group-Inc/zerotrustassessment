# 008: Data Warehouse

## Overview
Use the Intune Data Warehouse to build reports that provide insight into your enterprise mobile environment. For example, some of the reports include:

* Trend of users enrolling in Intune so you can optimize your license purchases
* App and OS versions breakdown so you can review that status of mobile devices
* Enrollment and device compliance trends so you can smoothly roll out policy updates

**Data Warehouse benefits**
The Data Warehouse provides you access to more information about your mobile environment than the Microsoft Intune admin center. With the Intune Data Warehouse you can access:
* Historical Intune data
* Data refreshed on a daily cadence
* A data model using the OData standard
