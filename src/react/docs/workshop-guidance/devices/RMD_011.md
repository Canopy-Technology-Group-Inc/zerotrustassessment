# 011: Offboarding Strategy

## Overview
When offboarding users from **Microsoft Intune**, consider the following best practices based on your specific scenario:

1. **Deleting a User**:
   - If you're completely removing a user from **Azure AD**, follow these steps:
     - **Retire or remote wipe devices**: Ensure all devices associated with the user are retired or wiped before deleting them from Azure AD. This prevents issues with device management.
     - **Remove from Intune Administrator groups**: Take the user out of any Azure AD security groups assigned Intune Administrator roles.
     - **Delete the user from Azure AD**: Once deleted, Microsoft Endpoint Manager will automatically remove the user from Intune reports, device enrollment manager (DEM) accounts, and other configurations.

2. **Keeping a User**:
   - If you want to preserve the user's account in Azure AD but prevent them from enrolling devices:
     - **Retire or remote wipe devices**: Clean up Intune reports by retiring or wiping devices enrolled by the user.
     - **Remove from Intune Administrator groups**: Similar to the deletion process, remove the user from any relevant security groups.
     - **Restrict device enrollment**: Add the user to an Azure AD security group with a device type enrollment restriction blocking all platforms.
     - **Revoke Android Enterprise tokens**: If applicable, revoke any Android Enterprise tokens granted to prevent new device enrollments.
