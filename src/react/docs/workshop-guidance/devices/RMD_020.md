# 020: Data protection

## Overview
The APP data protection configuration framework is organized into three distinct configuration scenarios:

**Level 1** **enterprise basic data protection**– Microsoft recommends this configuration as the minimum data protection configuration for an enterprise device.
**Level 2** **enterprise enhanced data protection** – Microsoft recommends this configuration for devices where users access sensitive or confidential information. This configuration is applicable to most mobile users accessing work or school data. Some of the controls may impact user experience.
**Level 3 enterprise high data protection** – Microsoft recommends this configuration for devices run by an organization with a larger or more sophisticated security team, or for specific users or groups who are at uniquely high risk (users who handle highly sensitive data where unauthorized disclosure causes considerable material loss to the organization). An     organization likely to be targeted by well-funded and sophisticated adversaries should aspire to this configuration.
