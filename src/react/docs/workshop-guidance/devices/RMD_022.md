# 022: Conditional launch

## Overview
Conditional launch actions within Intune app protection policies provide organizations the ability to block access or wipe org data when certain device or app conditions aren't met.

You can explicitly choose to wipe your company's corporate data from the end user's device as an action to take for noncompliance by using these settings. For some settings, you're able to configure multiple actions, such as block access and wipe data based on different specified values.
