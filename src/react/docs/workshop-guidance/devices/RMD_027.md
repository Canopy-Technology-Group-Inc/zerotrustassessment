# 027: RBAC

## Overview
A role defines the set of permissions granted to users assigned to that role. You can use both the built-in and custom roles. Built-in roles cover some common Intune scenarios. You can create your own custom roles with the exact set of permissions you need. Several Microsoft Entra roles have permissions to Intune. To see a role in the Intune admin center, go to Tenant administration > Roles > All roles > choose a role. You can manage the role on the following pages:

Properties: The name, description, permissions, and scope tags for the role.
Assignments: A list of role assignments defining which users have access to which users/devices. A role can have multiple assignments, and a user can be in multiple assignments.
