For example:

  *If a device is lost or stolen, you can reset or wipe the device.
  *Your help desk can reset a password, lock the device, or collect diagnostic data.
  *You can synchronize devices that haven't checked-in to Intune for a while.
  *Do a quick scan or full scan of a device using Microsoft Defender Antivirus.


Use remote device actions to help you manage your devices remotely, without having to physically touch the device. This feature is available for devices that are enrolled in Intune and devices that are enrolled in other mobile device management (MDM) services.

This feature applies to:

  *Android
  *iOS/iPadOS
  *macOS
  *Windows
