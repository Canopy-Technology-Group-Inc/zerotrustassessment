# 041: Require device lock

## Overview
This setting determines whether the Android device has a device PIN that meets the minimum password requirement. The App protection policy can take action if the device lock doesn’t meet the minimum password requirement.
Values include:

  *Low Complexity
  
  *Medium Complexity
  
  *High Complexity
  
  **This complexity value is targeted to Android 12+. For devices operating on Android 11 and earlier, setting a complexity value of low, medium, or high will default to the expected behavior for Low Complexity. For more information, see Google's developer documentation getPasswordComplexity, PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_LOW,       PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_MEDIUM, and PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_HIGH.

Actions include:

  *Warn - The user sees a notification if the device lock doesn’t meet the minimum password requirement. The notification can be dismissed.
  
  *Block access - The user will be blocked from access if the device lock doesn’t meet the minimum password requirement.
  
  *Wipe data - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device if the device lock doesn’t meet the minimum password requirement.
