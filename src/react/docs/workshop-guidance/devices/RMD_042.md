**Note:** The user must accept the Samsung Knox terms before the device attestation check can be performed. If the user doesn't accept the Samsung Knox terms, the specified action will occur.

**Note:** This setting will apply to all devices targeted. To apply this setting only to Samsung devices, you can use "Managed apps" assignment filters.
