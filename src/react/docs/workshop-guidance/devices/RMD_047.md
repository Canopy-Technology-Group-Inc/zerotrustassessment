# 047: RBAC

## Overview
Role-based access control (RBAC) helps you manage who has access to your organization's resources and what they can do with those resources. By assigning roles to your Intune users, you can limit what they can see and change. Each role has a set of permissions that determine what users with that role can access and change within your organization.
