# 048: Remote actions

## Overview
When a device is lost or stolen, or if the employee leaves your company, you want to make sure company app data is removed from the device. But you might not want to remove personal data on the device, especially if the device is an employee-owned device.

To selectively remove company app data, create a wipe request by using the steps in this article. After the request is finished, the next time the app runs on the device, company data is removed from the app. In addition, you can also configure a selective wipe of your company data as a new action when the conditions of Application Protection Policies (APP) Access settings aren't met. This feature helps you automatically protect and remove sensitive company data from applications based on preconfigured criteria.
