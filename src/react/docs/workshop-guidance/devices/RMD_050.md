# 050: Managed Edge Browser

## Overview
Edge for iOS and Android is designed to enable users to browse the web and supports multi-identity. Users can add a work account, as well as a personal account, for browsing. There's complete separation between the two identities, which is like what is offered in other Microsoft mobile apps.

This feature applies to:

   iOS/iPadOS 14.0 or later

   Android 8.0 or later for enrolled devices and Android 9.0 or later for unenrolled devices
   
------
Edge for iOS and Android supports app settings that allow unified endpoint management, like Microsoft Intune, administrators to customize the behavior of the app.

App configuration can be delivered either through the mobile device management (MDM) OS channel on enrolled devices (Managed App Configuration channel for iOS or the Android in the Enterprise channel for Android) or through the MAM (Mobile Application Management) channel. Edge for iOS and Android supports the following configuration scenarios:

*Only allow work or school accounts
*General app configuration settings
*Data protection settings
*Additional app configuration for managed devices
