# 052: Require Threat Scan on apps

## Overview
App protection policies support some of Google Play Protect's APIs. This setting in particular ensures that Google's Verify Apps scan is turned on for end user devices. If configured, the end user will be blocked from access until they turn on Google's app scanning on their Android device. 

Actions include:

**Warn** - The user sees a notification if Google's Verify Apps scan on the device is not turned on. This notification can be dismissed.

**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if Google's Verify Apps scan on the device is not turned on.

Results from Google's Verify Apps scan are surfaced in the Potentially Harmful Apps report in the console.
