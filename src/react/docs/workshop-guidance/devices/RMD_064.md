# 064: Wi-Fi

## Overview
You can create a profile with specific WiFi settings, and then deploy this profile to your iOS/iPadOS devices using Intune. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to authenticate your network, add a PKCS (Public Key Cryptography Standards) or SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) certificate, configure a proxy, and more.
