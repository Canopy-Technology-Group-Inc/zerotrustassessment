# 081: Review enrolled vs unenrolled for BYOD/Corporate

## Overview
In Microsoft Intune, there are several enrollment options for iOS devices, tailored for both **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** and **Corporate-owned devices**. Here’s a detailed overview of the available options:

### Enrollment Options for iOS Devices

#### 1. **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**
- **Type**: Corporate-owned devices.
- **Description**: Previously known as the Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP), this method allows organizations to enroll devices automatically when they are turned on for the first time. Devices must be purchased through Apple or authorized resellers and linked to the organization’s Apple Business Manager (ABM) or Apple School Manager (ASM).
- **Features**:
  - **Supervised Mode**: Provides enhanced management capabilities, such as restricting features and deploying software updates.
  - **Bulk Enrollment**: Ideal for enrolling a large number of devices without manual intervention.

#### 2. **Apple Configurator Enrollment**
- **Type**: Corporate-owned devices or existing devices.
- **Description**: This method is used for devices that are already in use or not purchased through ABM. Administrators can use Apple Configurator to prepare devices for enrollment.
- **Features**:
  - Allows for the configuration of settings and policies before the device is handed over to the user.

#### 3. **User Enrollment**
- **Type**: BYOD.
- **Description**: This option allows users to enroll their personal devices while keeping personal data separate from corporate data. It provides a lightweight management approach.
- **Features**:
  - **Privacy**: Users maintain control over their personal data, as only corporate apps and data are managed.
  - **Access to Corporate Resources**: Users can access corporate apps and resources while ensuring their personal data remains untouched.

#### 4. **Device Enrollment with Company Portal**
- **Type**: BYOD.
- **Description**: Users can enroll their personal devices through the Intune Company Portal app. This method is straightforward and user-initiated.
- **Features**:
  - Users can manage their enrolled devices and access corporate resources through the Company Portal.

#### 5. **Web-Based Enrollment**
- **Type**: BYOD.
- **Description**: This option allows users to enroll their devices via a web browser, eliminating the need for the Company Portal app for initial enrollment.
- **Features**:
  - **Just-in-Time Registration**: Streamlines the enrollment process by reducing the number of authentication prompts.

### Key Differences Between BYOD and Corporate Enrollment

- **Data Management**:
  - **BYOD**: Focuses on managing corporate data while preserving user privacy. Only corporate apps and data are managed.
  - **Corporate Enrollment**: Provides full management capabilities, allowing IT to enforce policies and configurations on the entire device.

- **User Experience**:
  - **BYOD**: Users have more control over their devices and can choose to enroll only for corporate access.
  - **Corporate Enrollment**: Users may have limited control over device settings, as IT manages the entire device.

- **Enrollment Process**:
  - **BYOD**: Typically involves user-initiated enrollment through the Company Portal or web-based methods.
  - **Corporate Enrollment**: Often involves automated processes through ADE or Apple Configurator for seamless setup.
