# 115: Co-management Strategy

## Overview

Co-management allows you to manage Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices using both Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune.It lets you cloud-attach your existing investment in Configuration Manager by adding new functionality from Intune.

You control which workloads you switch the authority from Configuration Manager to Intune. 

When you enroll existing Configuration Manager clients in co-management, you gain the following immediate value:

* Conditional access with device compliance

* Intune-based remote actions, for example: restart, remote control, or factory reset

* Centralized visibility of device health

* Link users, devices, and apps with Microsoft Entra ID

* Modern provisioning with Windows Autopilot

* Remote actions

Configuration Manager continues to manage all other workloads, including those workloads that you don't switch to Intune, and all other features of Configuration Manager that co-management doesn't support.
