# 119: Autopilot User Enrollment

## Overview

Autopilot User-Driven Enrollment streamlines the process of configuring new Windows devices, allowing users to enroll a device from factory state to a ready-to-use state without manual IT intervention. End users unbox the device, select language and network settings, and specify their organization email address and password. The device then joins the organization, enrolls in Microsoft Intune, and applies organization-specific configurations.

| **Scenario** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User-driven** | • Requires no interaction from admin/OEM/reseller.  <br>• Doesn't require [TPM attestation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/component-updates/tpm-key-attestation) so works on physical devices and VMs. | • Takes longer for user than the pre-provisioned scenario since user has to go through both device ESP and user ESP stages|
