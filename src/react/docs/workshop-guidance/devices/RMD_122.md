# 122: GP Preferences

## Overview

**Group Policy Preferences (GPP)** are a collection of Group Policy client-side extensions that deliver preference settings to domain-joined computers. Common GPPs are:

* Drive and printer mappings
* Scheduled Task management
* Registry key management
* Desktop shortcuts
* Local Users and Groups
* Services management

Not all of these have equivalents in Intune and Entra Join devices. Planning should be made to evaluate whether these tasks are used and still needed, and how they will be done with Intune.

[Account Protection policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/endpoint-security-account-protection-policy#manage-local-groups-on-windows-devices) in Endpoint Security can be used to manage local users and groups on Windows devices.

[Universal Print](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-whatis) is a modern print solution that organizations can use to manage their print infrastructure through cloud services from Microsoft.
