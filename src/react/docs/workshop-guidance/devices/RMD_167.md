## Overview

### Importance of Windows 11 for Zero Trust

**Windows 11** introduces several security features that align with the principles of **Zero Trust**:

* Windows 11 includes advanced security measures such as hardware-based isolation, encryption, and malware protection. Features like **Windows Hello** for passwordless authentication and **Secured-core PCs** help protect against sophisticated threats.

* **Device Health Attestation** ensures that devices are in a secure state before granting access to corporate resources. It verifies the integrity of the device's firmware, boot process, and operating system.

* **Zero Trust DNS** feature restricts devices to connect only to approved network destinations, ensuring that outbound traffic is secure and monitored.

* Regular updates ensure that devices are protected against the latest threats, maintaining a secure environment.

### Windows 11 and Intune

* Intune allows administrators to create and deploy feature update policies, making it easier to upgrade devices from Windows 10 to Windows 11. This process can be automated and monitored through the Intune admin center.

* Intune provides tools to assess the readiness of devices for Windows 11. **Endpoint Analytics** helps identify which devices meet the hardware requirements and are ready for the upgrade.

* Intune can enforce security policies and configurations to ensure that all devices comply with organizational standards. This includes setting up compliance policies, configuration profiles, and conditional access.

* Administrators can use Intune to deploy updates in phases, reducing the risk of widespread issues. This approach allows for testing and validation before a broader rollout.

* Intune provides detailed reports on the status of updates and compliance, helping administrators track progress and address any issues promptly.
