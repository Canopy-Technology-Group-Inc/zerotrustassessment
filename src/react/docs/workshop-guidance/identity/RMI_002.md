# 002: Stop buying or building Active Directory dependent apps

## Overview

New applications procured or built by the organization should use modern authentication protocols and use Entra ID as the identity provider.

This is important for zero trust because this will natively enable security controls for new applications moving forward. This includes natively integrating with conditional access policies, consistent visiblity through sign-in, and audit logs, ability to grant/remove access, etc.
