# 003: Discover and triage modern apps

## Overview

Identify all the applications in the environment that use SAML, WS-Federation, Oauth, or Open ID Connect across the existing systems (e.g. ADFS, or similar on prem or cloud IDPs) that will be migrated to Entra ID. This is an important step to plan migration efforts. 

Having all the applications using Entra ID as their identity provider will enable the zero trust benefits to those applications.
