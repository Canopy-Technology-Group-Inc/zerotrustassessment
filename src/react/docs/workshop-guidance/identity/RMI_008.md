# 008: Rollout CA for External Identities

## Overview

Configure cross-tenant access settings, and create dedicated conditional access policies targeting external users. 

Cross-tenant access settings allow you to configure whether to trust the MFA or device claims for external organizations that are also in Entra ID. In the context of zero trust, the device health claim from external organizations is an important consideration.
