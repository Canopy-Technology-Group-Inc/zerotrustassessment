# 012: Define app infra server management strategy

## Overview

In general, cloud-first tools and approaches align better to zero trust principles. Most enterprises have on-premises servers as part of the infrastructure to support applications and resources. 

Defining an approach that does not rely exclusively on Active Directory and other on-premises tool allows you to better align to a zero trust in the following ways:

* Unified Security Posture: Cloud services offer centralized security management across diverse environments (on-premises, cloud, multi-cloud), enhancing the enforcement of consistent security policies.
* Advanced Threat Detection and Response: Integrated security features in cloud platforms, like automated threat detection and response, support the Zero Trust principle of assuming breach and maintaining strict surveillance.
* Automated Compliance: Cloud services automate compliance monitoring and remediation across all managed servers, ensuring continuous alignment with regulatory and organizational policies.
* Modern approaches: Cloud-native infrastructure can be more easily managed using DevOps, Infrastructure as Code, and CI/CD approaches. These approaches to infrastructure management enable more customer agility while also facilitating application modernization.
