# 020: Migrate SSO for External Identities federated apps

## Overview

Migrate SSO configuration of applications for external identities (contractors, partners, vendors, etc.) from on-premises IDPs like ADFS to Entra ID. Those applications can benefit from the entire set of capabilities available in Entra ID. In the context of zero trust, this is important to enable policy enforcement via conditional access.
