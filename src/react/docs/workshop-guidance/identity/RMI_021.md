# 021: Migrate SSO for external ids (WAM & others)

## Overview

Migrate SSO configuration of applications for external identities (contractors, partners, vendors, etc.) from on-premises WAM Solutions like CA Siteminder to Entra ID. Those applications can benefit from the entire set of capabilities available in Entra ID. In the context of zero trust, this is important to enable policy enforcement via conditional access.
