# 036: Turn on Password Hash Sync

## Overview

Turn on Password Hash sync as a backup for your federated environment (if present). This feature also enables additional risk detections such as leaked credentials and password spray; these detections, in turn, help the system to better calculate the user risk and consequently target them with conditional policies (for example, if a user risk is high, then users must reset their passwords).
