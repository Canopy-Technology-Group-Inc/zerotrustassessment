# 062: Use cloud-only privileged accounts

## Overview

Use cloud-only accounts for privileged roles in the cloud. Identify all accounts with privilege role memberships and audit which accounts are synced from on-premises AD. Create a plan to create a new cloud-only account for each synced admin account. Give the cloud-only admin accounts similar or identical role assignments as the synced accounts.

Remove the role assignments from the synced accounts and consider removing them from sync scope in Entra Connect entirely. Ensure that your administrators know to use the new cloud-only administrator accounts.
