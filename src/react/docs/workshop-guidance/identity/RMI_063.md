# 063: Rollout PIM for Tier-Zero roles

## Overview

Enable JIT activation of privileged roles for the most critical roles such as Global Administrator. Identify which roles are considered the most privileged in your environment - common roles might be Global Administrator, Azure subscription Owner, Hybrid Domain Administrator, Privileged Role Administrator, and other business-specific roles. Enable all role holders for these roles so that their permissions are managed through a JIT solution, such as Entra Privileged Identity Management.
