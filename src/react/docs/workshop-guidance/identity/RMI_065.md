# 065: Lock down Entra tenant config

## Overview

Review the configuration of the Entra ID tenant and lock down settings per business needs and MS best practices. Ensure that major changes to configurations or policies in the tenant must go through change control processes. When change control is not followed, audit the changes and deal with them through the Security Operations Center (SOC).

Consider opportunities to make changes through CI/CD processes rather than via manual human activity.
