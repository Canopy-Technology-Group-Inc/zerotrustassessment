# 066: Rollout Access Reviews for cloud privileged accounts & groups

## Overview

Rollout periodic access reviews for privileged users and groups. Leverage governance tooling to regularly review entitlements in the environment. This is critical for highly privileged roles and similar entitlements. However, its also a best practice to leverage a review process for most entitlements, including those without Tier Zero type permissions. This ensures that permissions are cleaned up over time regardless of the sensitivity of those permissions.
