# 067: Plan privileged accounts lifecycle (JML)

## Overview

Define the approach to create, update, delete privileged accounts. Privileged accounts need a Joiner / Mover / Leaver lifecycle like any other user. However, they are typically tied to the lifecycle events of other user accounts, such as the administrator's day to day account. Develop a process to create, update, and remove privileged accounts as the administrators join the organization, change job roles, and leave the organization. Job changes are a great opportunity to review if admin rights are still required for a particular user.
