# 068: Rollout PIM for remaining roles

## Overview

Enable JIT activation of privileged roles for remaining role assignments. Just In Time activation should be used for all privileged roles, including non-Tier Zero roles. Update all Entra ID role assignments to leverage JIT, potentially using Entra Privileged Identity Management or a similar tool. Consider enabling other roles for JIT as well, such as those based on group memberships or Azure roles.
