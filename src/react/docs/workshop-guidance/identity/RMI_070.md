# 070: Rollout strong auth credentials for Workload Identities

## Overview

Use Azure Managed Identities and certificates for cloud workload identities. Organizations should establish a pattern where workload identities and automation credentials use one of the options below:

- Managed identity
- Certificate
- Federated workload identity

Customers should avoid using the weakest option:

- Client secret

Usage of client secrets should require an exception, since it should violate normal security requirements.
