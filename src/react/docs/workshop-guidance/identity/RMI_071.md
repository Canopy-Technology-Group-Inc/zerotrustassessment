# 071: Rollout Conditional Access for Workload Identities

## Overview

Define conditional access policies that target workload identities. Conditional Access for workload identities enables customers to protect automations and workloads using one of the following options:

- Restrict workload identity authentication to specific public IP ranges. This is especially useful if particular workloads should only authenticate from a customer-controlled network with well-defined egress IP addresses.
- Block risky service principals from authenticating
