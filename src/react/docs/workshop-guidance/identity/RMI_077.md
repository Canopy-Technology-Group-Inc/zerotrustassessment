# 077: Implement monitoring for Entra Connect Sync

## Overview

Deploy Entra Connect Health for monitoring of Entra Connect and ADFS. Entra Connect Health can be used to do hybrid monitoring of on-premises sync and authentication infrastructure - alerts and findings can be generated directly in the Entra ID tenant without any dependency on traditional on-premises monitoring tools.

Ensure that Entra Connect Health is functioning for every hybrid infrastructure server in the environment to avoid blind spots that can lead to security issues or user impacts.
