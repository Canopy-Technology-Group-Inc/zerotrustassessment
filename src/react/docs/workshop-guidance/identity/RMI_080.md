# 080: Discover existing privileged roles

## Overview

Create an inventory that outlines who in the organization has privileged roles.

For existing privileged roles, analyze, update, and assign the least privileged role where possible. This effort should consist of several steps:

- Define a written organizational policy regarding least privilege roles
- Analyze role usage in the organization to understand what tasks are regularly performed and which roles best align to those tasks
- Create evidence to show which role assignments may need to be reduced based on analysis and investigation
