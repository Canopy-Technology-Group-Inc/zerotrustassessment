# Discover App Usage and plan for App Segmentation

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low 

## Overview
Before organizations can start with any segmentation strategy, they should have visibility into the network infrastrucutre estate as well as visibility to the application usage by their user population. Traditional approaches, particular for remote access do not suffice these needs. 

Application discovery enables administrators to gain comprehensive visibility into application usage within their corporate network. By identifying which applications are accessed and by whom, administrators can create private applications with precise segmentation and least privilege access, which minimizes unnecessary access.
