# Secure sensitive legacy AppAccess with PIM

## Overview
Identify all the applications in the environment that use Integrated Windows Authentication, LDAP, Kerberos, or similar legacy protocols
For the scenario where you need to control access to specific critical resources, such as highly valued servers and applications, Microsoft recommends that you add an extra security layer by enforcing just-in-time privileged access on top of their already secured private access.
