# Implement DC Agent for Microsoft Entra Private Access
 
## Overview

*Private Preview:* - DC Agent for Private Access. 
Take legacy authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos and NTLM which are still widely used and provide the admin with the option to impose modern authentication capabilities on top of them. An Admin is managing an on Prem resource and wants to protect it from direct on-prem access with capabilities such as MFA. This is not supported with either Kerberos or NTLM and our goal is to allow it.
Imagine a scenario where an employee is working on-premises at their company's headquarters. They need to access the company's DCs to retrieve some important information for their project or make some changes. However, when they try to access the DC directly, they find that access is blocked. This is because the company has enabled privileged access, which restricts direct access to the DC for security reasons. Instead of accessing the DC directly, the employee's traffic is intercepted by the Global Secure Access Client and routed to the Microsoft Entra ID and Private Access Cloud for authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access the DC and its resources.
