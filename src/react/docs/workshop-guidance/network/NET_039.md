# Advanced SWG: Implement Threat Intelligence filtering

**Implementation Effort:** Low

**User Impact:** Medium
 
## Overview

Threat Intelligence (TI)  empowers you to protect your users from accessing malicious resources on the internet, based on real-time data on current threats. TI will protect users from accessing known-bad internet destinations based on domain and URL indicators from both 1P and 3P threat intelligence providers.

- Identify and block access to destinations labeled as "High Severity" threats based on FQDN or URL.
  -- Threats identified according to Microsoft and 3rd Party Threat intel sources
- Configure allow list of FQDNs to handle false positives. (This is the first feature fully shipped in GSA Object Model v2!!)
- Enrich the traffic log with the Threat Type (e.g., Botnet, C2, Phishing, Malware, etc.) of the matched indicator.
- Provide user and context aware-policy through the Identity-centric Conditional Access policy integration.
