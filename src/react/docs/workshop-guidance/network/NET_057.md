 # Deploy Azure Firewall and route all outbound and inbound traffic through it.

**Implementation Effort:** High

**User Impact:** Medium

## Overview

Deploy Azure Firewall as a central inspection and enforcement point by creating an AzureFirewallSubnet in a hub VNet and provisioning the firewall there. Then override the default system routes with custom user-defined routes (UDRs) pointing all north–south and east–west traffic to the firewall’s private IP—either manually or via Azure Firewall Manager—so that every packet flows through your policy enforcement plane.

Use Firewall Manager to centrally apply and manage both the firewall and firewall policies for consistent security posture
