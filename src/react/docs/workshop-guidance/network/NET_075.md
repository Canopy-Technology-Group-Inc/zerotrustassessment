#  Enable and configure TLS inspection on Azure Firewall policy to Inspect all east-west TLS traffic to allow/deny with IDPS and Application rules
**Implementation Effort:** High

**User Impact:** Medium

## Overview

In your Azure Firewall Premium policy, enable TLS inspection to decrypt and inspect all eastâ€“west (internal) TLS traffic between VNets and peered networks. Once Enabled, Azure Firewall will intercept TLS handshakes, decrypt sessions using the configured CA certificate from Key Vault, apply your IDPS signature checks and application rule collections against the plaintext traffic, then re-encrypt and forward the sessions to their internal destinations. This ensures that lateral movement attempts over encrypted channels are subject to the same intrusion prevention and application-layer controls as perimeter traffic.
