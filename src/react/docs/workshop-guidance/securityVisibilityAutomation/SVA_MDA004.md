# Create File Policies with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

**Implementation Effort:** Medium. Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to set up and manage file policies effectively.

**User Impact:** Medium. A subset of non-privileged users may need to take action or be notified of changes, especially if their file sharing practices are affected.

## Overview
File policies in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps allow organizations to enforce automated processes using cloud provider APIs. These policies can perform continuous compliance scans, legal eDiscovery tasks, and data loss prevention (DLP) for sensitive content shared publicly. They fit into the Zero Trust framework by ensuring that files are continuously monitored and governed based on content and context filters, thereby protecting sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access.
