# Create Cloud Discovery Policies - Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

**Implementation Effort:** Low: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to set up and manage these policies, including configuring alerts and thresholds.

**User Impact:** Low: A subset of non-privileged users may need to be notified or take action if their activities trigger these policies.

## Overview
Cloud Discovery Policies in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps allow organizations to monitor and control the use of cloud applications by setting alerts for new or risky apps detected within the environment. These policies help enforce the Zero Trust framework by ensuring that only sanctioned and secure applications are used, thereby reducing the risk of shadow IT and potential security breaches.
