# Create activity policies - Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

**Implementation Effort:** Low: Setting up activity policies requires configuring various filters and conditions, which involves a moderate level of effort from IT and Security Operations teams.

**User Impact:** Low: Alerts generated by these policies may require a subset of non-privileged users to take action or be notified, especially if their activities are flagged as suspicious.

## Overview
Activity policies in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps allow administrators to monitor specific user activities and set custom alerts for suspicious patterns, such as multiple failed sign-ins or large file downloads. These policies are crucial for enforcing security measures and ensuring compliance within the Zero Trust framework by detecting and responding to potential threats in real-time.
