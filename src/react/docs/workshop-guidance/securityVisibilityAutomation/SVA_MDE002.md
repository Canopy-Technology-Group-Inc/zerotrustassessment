# Prepare to deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint deployment


**Implementation Effort:** Medium: There will be some planning steps that may require some cross-team collaboration

**User Impact:** Low: there is no end user impact

## Overview
The next step when deploying Defender for Endpoint is to assign [roles and permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/prepare-deployment) for the Defender for Endpoint deployment.

**Note:** Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.
