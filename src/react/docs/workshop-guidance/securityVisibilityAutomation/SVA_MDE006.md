# Set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to active mode



**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** high

## Overview
Microsoft Defender Antivirus is the next-generation protection component of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Although you can use a non-Microsoft antivirus solution with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, there are advantages to using Microsoft Defender Antivirus together with Defender for Endpoint. Not only is Microsoft Defender Antivirus an excellent next-generation antivirus solution, but combined with other Defender for Endpoint capabilities, such as endpoint detection and response and automated investigation and remediation, you get better protection that's coordinated across products and services.

In active mode, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is used as the primary antivirus app on the device. Files are scanned, threats are remediated, and detected threats are listed in your organization's security reports and in your Windows Security app.
