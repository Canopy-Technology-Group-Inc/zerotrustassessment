# Endpoint detection and response in block mode

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to enable and configure EDR in block mode, ensuring compatibility with existing antivirus solutions.

**User Impact:** Low: Action can be taken by administrators, users donâ€™t have to be notified.

## Overview
Endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode provides added protection from malicious artifacts when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not the primary antivirus product and is running in passive mode. It helps remediate malicious artifacts that might have been missed by the primary antivirus solution, fitting into the Zero Trust framework by enhancing post-breach detection and response capabilities.
