# Enable cloud protection



**Implementation Effort:** High

**User Impact:** High

## Overview
Cloud protection is a cloud-based extension of Microsoft Defender Antivirus that uses real-time intelligence to detect and block threats faster and more accurately. It enhances security by enabling rapid threat detection, reducing false positives, and supporting advanced features like Block at First Sight.

Cloud protection is enabled by default. However, you might need to re-enable it if it has been disabled as part of previous organizational policies.
