**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to configure and deploy these rules across the organization.

**User Impact:** Medium: A subset of non-privileged users may need to be notified of changes, especially if the rules affect their workflow or application usage.

## Overview
Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules help prevent malware from infecting devices by blocking actions that malware often uses to exploit systems. These rules are a key component of the Zero Trust framework, enhancing security by reducing the attack surface and limiting the potential vectors for cyber threats.
