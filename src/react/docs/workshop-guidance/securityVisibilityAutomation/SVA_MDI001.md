# Lay the Groundwork for Microsoft Defender for Identity

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — While the deployment requires planning and coordination across teams, it follows a well-documented process and can be phased in gradually.

**User Impact:** Medium — Although end users are not directly involved, security teams may need to notify certain users or departments if identity-related alerts or investigations arise during rollout.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI) is a cloud-native security solution that helps detect identity-based threats by analyzing signals from Active Directory environments. It identifies suspicious activities such as lateral movement, credential theft, and privilege escalation, and integrates with Microsoft Defender XDR for broader threat correlation.

Laying the groundwork includes:
- Reviewing prerequisites and licensing.
- Identifying domain controllers and network topology.
- Installing sensors and configuring data collection.
- Planning alert management and incident response workflows.

Without MDI, organizations may lack visibility into identity-based attack vectors, which are often exploited early in breach attempts. This deployment supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume Breach"** by continuously monitoring identity signals and surfacing anomalies that indicate compromise.
