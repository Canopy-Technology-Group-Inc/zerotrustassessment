# Roles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel

**Implementation Effort:** Low: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to set up and manage Azure RBAC roles within Microsoft Sentinel.

**User Impact:** Low: A subset of non-privileged users, such as security analysts and responders, need to take action or be notified of changes.

## Overview
Microsoft Sentinel uses Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage permissions for various user roles within the security operations team. This setup allows fine-grained control over what users can see and do in Microsoft Sentinel, ensuring appropriate access to security data and resources.
