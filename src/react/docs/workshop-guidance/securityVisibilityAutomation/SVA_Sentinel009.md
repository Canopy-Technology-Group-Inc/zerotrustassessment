# Configure Interactive and Long-Term Data Retention

**Implementation Effort:** Medium - Customer IT teams need to drive projects to configure retention settings, set up policies, and manage permissions.
**User Impact:** Low - Actions can be taken by administrators, and users donâ€™t have to be notified.

## Overview
Configuring interactive and long-term data retention involves managing how data is stored and accessed over time in services like Log Analytics and Microsoft Sentinel. Interactive retention is used for monitoring and troubleshooting, while long-term retention is for cost-effective storage. This process fits into the Zero Trust framework by ensuring data is securely retained and accessible only to authorized personnel.
