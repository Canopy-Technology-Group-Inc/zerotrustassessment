# Watchlists in Microsoft Sentinel

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Setting up watchlists requires creating and managing data sources, configuring detection rules, and maintaining the watchlists over time.

**User Impact:** low: A subset of non-privileged users, such as security analysts, need to take action or be notified of changes.

## Overview
Watchlists in Microsoft Sentinel allow you to correlate data from various sources with events in your Sentinel environment. They are used for threat investigation, incident response, and enriching event data, fitting into the Zero Trust framework by enhancing security monitoring and response capabilities.
