# Enable User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) in Microsoft Sentinel

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Enabling UEBA in Microsoft Sentinel requires configuring settings and ensuring appropriate roles and permissions, which involves a moderate level of effort from IT and Security Operations teams
**User Impact:** Low: The actions required to enable UEBA are primarily administrative and do not necessitate changes or notifications to non-privileged users 

## Overview
Enabling User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) in Microsoft Sentinel allows the system to analyze logs and alerts from connected data sources, building behavioral profiles of entities such as users, hosts, and applications. By identifying anomalous activities, it helps in detecting potential security threats and compromised assets. This capability is crucial for enhancing security posture within the Zero Trust framework by continuously monitoring and analyzing entity behavior
