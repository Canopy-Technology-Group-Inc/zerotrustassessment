# Threat intelligence integration in Microsoft Sentinel

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Integrating threat intelligence feeds requires configuring data connectors and possibly coordinating with vendors to obtain necessary credentials and API details.

**User Impact:** Low: Security analysts and a subset of IT staff need to be aware of the integration and may need to take action to utilize the threat intelligence data effectively.

## Overview
Integrating Microsoft Threat Intelligence feeds into Microsoft Sentinel enhances the ability of security analysts to detect and prioritize known threats. This integration can be achieved through various methods, including connecting to TAXII servers, using integrated threat intelligence platform products, or custom solutions that communicate with the Threat Intelligence Upload Indicators API. This capability fits into the Zero Trust framework by ensuring continuous monitoring and analysis of threat data to protect organizational assets.
