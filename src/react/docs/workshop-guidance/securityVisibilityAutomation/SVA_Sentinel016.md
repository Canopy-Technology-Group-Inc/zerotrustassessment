# Normalization and the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to integrate and utilize ASIM across various data sources.

**User Impact:** Low: A subset of non-privileged users, such as security analysts, have to take action or be notified of changes.

## Overview
The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) is designed to normalize data from various sources into a uniform format, facilitating easier analysis and correlation. ASIM fits into the Zero Trust framework by ensuring consistent and reliable data handling across diverse telemetry sources, enhancing security operations and threat detection.
