# Understand security coverage by the MITRE ATT&CK® framework

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to configure data connectors, set up query rules, and ensure permissions.

**User Impact:** Low: A subset of non-privileged users, such as security analysts, need to take action or be notified of changes.

## Overview
Microsoft Sentinel uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework to help organizations understand their security coverage by analyzing ingested data to detect threats and visualize security status. This feature allows users to view active analytics rules and configure new ones based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, enhancing threat detection and response capabilities.
