# View and Manage SOC Optimization Recommendations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium. Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to integrate and utilize SOC optimization recommendations effectively.

**User Impact:** Low. Actions can be taken by administrators, and users donâ€™t have to be notified.

## Overview
SOC optimization recommendations help Security Operations Center (SOC) teams improve processes and outcomes by providing actionable insights to optimize security controls and data ingestion. This ensures efficient use of resources and maximizes return on investment while maintaining necessary security coverage. The documentation provides detailed information on how SOC optimization recommendations are generated by analyzing ingested logs and enabled analytics rules. It helps SOC teams address specific types of attacks by comparing current logs and detections with those needed for effective threat management. Additionally, it explains how to use the Microsoft Sentinel recommendations API to programmatically interact with SOC optimization recommendations, allowing SOC teams to automate the process of closing coverage gaps and optimizing data ingestion rates across workspaces.
