# Sentinel Playbooks

**Implementation Effort:** Medium - Setting up and managing playbooks requires configuring Azure Logic Apps and automation rules, which involves project-level effort.

**User Impact:** Low - Actions are primarily taken by administrators, and users do not need to be notified.

## Overview
Microsoft Sentinel playbooks are collections of procedures that can be run automatically or manually in response to incidents, alerts, or entities. They help automate and orchestrate responses, fitting into the Zero Trust framework by ensuring consistent and automated threat mitigation. Playbooks can be triggered by specific alerts and incidents or run manually, enhancing the Zero Trust approach by automating threat response.
