# Enable Unified Security Operations Platform

**Implementation Effort:** Medium. This effort score was chosen because deploying the unified security operations platform requires planning, configuration, and ongoing management across multiple services and environments.

**User Impact:** Low. This ranking was chosen because a subset of non-privileged users, such as security analysts, will need to interact with the platform, but the majority of users will not need to take action.

## Overview
The Unified Security Operations Platform integrates Microsoft Defender portal, Microsoft Sentinel, and other Defender services to provide a comprehensive view of an organization's security posture. It helps detect, investigate, and respond to threats, fitting into the Zero Trust framework by ensuring continuous monitoring and adaptive protection across all environments.
