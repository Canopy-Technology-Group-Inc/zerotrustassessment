# Hunt for Threats and Investigate Incidents

**Implementation Effort:** Medium - This requires ongoing time and resource commitment from security operations teams to create hypotheses, conduct hunts, and act on findings.

**User Impact:** Low - A subset of non-privileged users, mainly security analysts, need to take action or be notified of changes.

## Overview
This documentation covers various aspects of threat hunting and incident investigation using Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender. Security analysts can proactively hunt for threats by creating hypotheses, searching through data, validating findings, and taking actions such as creating new detections or incidents. Additionally, advanced hunting features in Microsoft Defender allow analysts to investigate incidents related to devices, files, IP addresses, URLs, users, emails, mailboxes, or cloud resources. These capabilities fit into the Zero Trust framework by enabling continuous monitoring, proactive threat detection, and thorough investigation and response to security incidents.
